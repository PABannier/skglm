class ReweightedEstimator(GeneralizedLinearEstimator):
    r"""Reweighted L1-norm estimator.

    This estimator iteratively solves a non-convex objective by iteratively solving
    convex surrogates. They are obtained by iteratively re-weighting the \ell_1-norm
    by a penalty applied to the coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, optional
        Penalty strength.

    datafit : instance of BaseDatafit, optional
        Datafit. If None, `datafit` is initialized as a `Quadratic` datafit.
        `datafit` is replaced by a JIT-compiled instance when calling fit.

    solver : instance of BaseSolver, optional
        Solver. If None, `solver` is initialized as an `AndersonCD` solver.

    n_reweights : int, optional
        Number of reweighting iterations.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        parameter vector (w in the cost function formula)

    loss_history_ : list
        Objective history after every reweighting iteration

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)

        y : array-like, shape (n_samples,)

        reweight_penalty: Callable, optional
            Callable to compute the weights from the coefficients.
