class ReweightedLasso(Lasso):
    r"""Reweighted Lasso estimator.

    The objective reads::
        ||y-Xw||_2^2 / (2 * n_samples) + \lambda \sqrt{||w||}

    This estimator iteratively solves a non-convex objective by iteratively solving
    convex surrogates. They are obtained by iteratively re-weighting the \ell_1-norm
    by a penalty applied to the coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, optional
        Penalty strength.

    n_reweights : int, optional
        Number of reweighting iterations.

    args: list
        Parameters for the inner Lasso estimator.
        Note that `warm_start` is consistently set to `True` for performance reasons.

    kwargs: dict
        Keyword parameters for the inner Lasso estimator.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        parameter vector (w in the cost function formula)

    loss_history_ : list
        Objective history after every reweighting iteration

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples and

            Callable to compute the weights from the coefficients.
